# learn-python
Journey into learning Python restarted in 2020 with Python 3

As I learn Python, I will cover the concepts I have learned as I demonstrate all exercises performed.
Currently most of the material is what I am covering in the Python 3 Codecademy Pro course.

What I have learned so far:

- Multiple return values in functions
- Lists, tuples and list comprehension
- Using loops in lists and functions
- Converting iterating elements inside a loop
- Using range inside a loop
- First try at FizzBuzz
- List comprehensions
- Random module
- Matplot example using Random module
- Decimal Module example
- Handling exceptions using Try and Except
- Using .get() in dictionaries and auto-assigning non-existent key values
- Iterating through modifying values in dictionaries
-
